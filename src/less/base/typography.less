Headings and Paragraphs

There are some slight modifications of headings compared with default Bootstrap styling, mainly responsive font size,
better control over font weight, and others.

Markup:
<h1>Heading Level 1</h1>
<h2>Heading Level 2</h2>
<h3>Heading Level 3</h3>
<h4>Heading Level 4</h4>
<p class="lead">This is perex. But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and
praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the

// Colors
//
// Synergic UI uses Bootstrap’s `@brand-primary` variable to color the entire UI. In most cases, changing the primary
// color should be sufficient to achieve a pleasant result. If not, the UI can be heavily customized via Bootstrap’s
// variables: see `src/less/config/variables.less` and `bower_components/bootstrap/less/variables.less` for more.
