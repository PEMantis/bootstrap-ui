## Built on Bootstrap 3

This a living styleguide of **Synergic UI**, a UI library for building responsive admin interfaces. It is a
**lightweight extension** built on the shoulders of a
giant&thinsp;—&thinsp;[**Bootstrap 3**](http://www.getbootstrap.com).

Bootstrap itself is a great tool for quick creating admin interfaces. Synergic UI extends its capabilities with some
features and components that are common in admin UIs, yet too specific to be included in the original framework.

Synergic UI has been made by professionals for professionals. It is rather a styleguide than a ready-to-use
administration frontend with a dashboard full of eye-catching widgets. The aim of Synergic UI is to enable building
quality, responsive, intuitive, and easy-to-use admin interfaces that look and work well out of box, with as few lines
of code on top of Bootstrap’s codebase as possible.

**Technologies used:**

- [**Bootstrap 3**](http://www.getbootstrap.com) together with [jQuery](http://www.jquery.com)
- [LESS modules](https://github.com/adamkudrna/less-modules)
- [Bower](http://bower.io)
- [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com)
- [Styleguide generator](https://github.com/indieisaconcept/grunt-styleguide) using
[KSS syntax](http://warpspire.com/kss/syntax/)
